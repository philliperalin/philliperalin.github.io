                                <p>This project was advised by Dr. Vinicius Louro.</p>
								<h4>Aim of the Project</h4>
                                <p>The aim of this project is to produce indicators
									of potential gold mineralization resulting from
									of hydrothermal alteration processes.
									This objective was achieved by using Deep Learning to
									decrease data processing time. The identification was
									through the use of techniques to manipulate the
									gamma spectrometry data in order to help identify these processes. These techniques identified anomalous values of K, low values of Th/K ratio, and high values of factor F. The application
									of the model generated was in the
									Eastern portion of the Alta Floresta Gold Province which is located in the State of Mato Grosso, Brazil.
									This place is recognized for its potential
									auriferous. A secondary objective was to
									explore different Deep
									Learning algorithms, analysis, and quality control of
									results obtained in order to get the
									tools that best fit the
									problem and research settings.
                                </p>
								<h4>Methods</h4>
                                <p>Gamma spectrometry surveys quantify the emissions of electromagnetic radiation emitted by the decay of
									radioactive elements in a given region. Based on this, it is possible to obtain estimates of element concentrations
									(K, U, and Th) from airborne equipment (Kearey et al., 2002).
									K anomalies may indicate Cu-Au porphyries deposits and gold epithermal deposits as results of processes of sericitic or potassium alteration (Dickson and Scott. 1997). Maps produced with the ratio of
									Th/K and F factor (K*U/Th) provide a more precise indication of the places with hydrothermal alteration related to gold and copper mineralization (Ribeiro et al., 2014). </p>
                                <p>These gamma spectrometric data were used for training Deep Learning networks for the recognition of these signatures relevant to the identification of potential gold mineralization. Deep Learning is a sub-area of ​​Machine Learning that use mathematical models created with the ability to make predictions or take decisions from data sets and without be explicitly programmed (Goodfellow
									et al., 2016). Deep Learning, therefore, does the recognition of the patterns present in the data through mathematical models
									based in artificial neural network (Goodfellow et al., 2016 and Schmidhuber, 2015). Supervised learning was used to train the network. This technique consists of the presentation of data to the algorithm with class tags for each data. These tags were created from public images obtained from the CPRM (Brazilian Geological Survey) geoscientific database. The neural network
									used for learning the data patterns and generation of models was the YOLOv5 network (Jocher, 2021). This one is able to
									classify images and characterize the limits of the
									class searched within the image.</p>
									<h4>Results</h4>
									<p>The trained models showed no evidence of overfitting. The application of these for validation in the test data presents satisfactory results. These models when tested in the test images identify almost all regions of interest.</p>
									<p>The results obtained by the algorithm built from three Deep Learning models (K anomaly, low Th/K values and high F factor values) applied on the ternary gamma spectrometric map of the eastern portion of the Alta Floresta Gold Province are illustrated in the figure below. Data on gold mineral occurrences and mining locations obtained from the literature (Silva and Abram, 2008) it is possible to verify that regions indicated by the application of the algorithm on the region of interest (dark green regions on the map) are in line with information about garimpos (irregular mining activities) (red circles). The northern dark green region is a region with difficult accessibility and can be a place for further investigation.</p>

									<h4>Conclusion</h4>
									<p>As for any area of study in which Deep Learning techniques are intended to be applied, it is necessary to search for neural networks capable of adjusting and solving the necessary problem, without losing focus on the availability of resources and data for the realization of the project. In this way, the use of Deep Learning in the mining area needs a critical search for which algorithms to use according to these peculiarities.</p>
									<p>The results obtained show that the use of Machine Learning can help in the interpretation of gamma spectrometry data and generate insights into remote regions. Added to this, the main advantage is the reduction of the time invested in the processing and delimitation of exploratory targets from geophysical aerial survey data. With this time reduction, it is possible to spend more time interpreting the results generated by the model through geological and geophysical knowledge.</p>
